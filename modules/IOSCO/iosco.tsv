For technical reasons, it can take several days for the black-out to come into effect.Consob draws investors’ attention to the importance of adopting the greatest diligence in order to make informed investment choices, adopting common sense behaviours, essential to safeguard their savings: these include, for websites that offer financial services, checking in advance that the operator with whom they are investing is authorised, and, for offers of financial products, that a prospectus has been published.	http://www.consob.it/web/consob-and-its-activities/warnings?viewId=ultime_com_tutela	2916

(www.pocketoption.com);- FAH Investment LTD (www.web.cryptozone24.com);- Muller Enterprise Ltd (www.aurumpro.co, https://aurumprofin.cc and https://aurum-pro-finance.cc);    FSM Smart Ltd (www.fsmsmarts.com).The number of sites blacked out since July last, when Consob got the power to order blackouts, thus rises to 131. The measures with which the aforementioned companies were ordered to terminate the abusive activity can be viewed on the website www.consob.it.The black-out of these websites by internet service providers operating on the Italian market is ongoing. For technical reasons, it can take several days for the black-out to come into effect.Consob draws investors’ attention to the importance of paying the utmost attention in order to make informed investment choices, focusing on those common sense behaviours - such as, for example, checking that the operator with whom you are investing is authorised - that are essential if you really want to safeguard and, hopefully, see a return. To this end, Consob would remind you that there is a section on the homepage of its website www.consob.it entitled "Be aware of fraud!", with useful information to warn investors against abusive operators.	http://www.consob.it/web/consob-and-its-activities/warnings?viewId=ultime_com_tutela	3187

The measures with which the aforementioned companies were ordered to terminate the abusive activity can be viewed on the website www.consob.it.The black-out of these websites by internet service providers operating on the Italian market is ongoing. For technical reasons, it can take several days for the black-out to come into effect.	http://www.consob.it/web/consob-and-its-activities/warnings?viewId=ultime_com_tutela	3340
3341	Rodeler Limited	Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa	Italy	2020-01-10	Regarding market intermediaries (investment and trading advisers, collective investment schemes, brokers, dealers, and transfer agents)Miscellaneous	CONSOB has adopted a precautionary measure prohibiting the operation in Italy of the Cypriot firm Rodeler Limited which is linked to the following websites:           more1.   www.24option.com;2.   www.rodeler.com;3.   www.24fx.com;4.   www.grandoption.com;5.   www.quickoption.com.This is the second precautionary measure of its kind, after the measure recently adopted against Cypriot company Hoch Capital Ltd. The measure, adopted based on article 7-quater, paragraph 4 of the Consolidated Law on Finance, in implementation of article 86 of MiFID2, the European directive on the provision of investment services - is intended to ensure that Italian investors are protected. This action became necessary after Rodeler Limited repeated its conduct in violation of the regulations in force despite the measures adopted by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC), the Cypriot national authority for the supervision of financial markets, following the reports sent by Consob to CySEC. The provision by Rodeler Limited of investment services in Italy, and the solicitation and acquisition of new clients in our country and continuing relations with Italian clients are therefore banned as a precaution. The company will therefore have to close the accounts of its Italian clients according to the instructions imparted by these customers. The ban is based on the many complaints made to Consob by Italian investors, including recently, complaining of serious irregularities on the part of the Cypriot intermediary. The complaints made regard, in particular, activities in contracts for difference (CfDs), financial instruments on which Consob - in line with similar measures adopted by ESMA, the European authority for the regulation and supervision of the financial markets - had already intervened on 20 June last, introducing restrictions in their offer to retail investors in Italy within the framework of the ‘product intervention’ rules. Among other things, the complaints refer to circumstances such as the total loss of invested capital, incorrect classification of clients and aggressive marketing techniques. Rodeler Limited, based in Limassol, is an intermediary registered under Cypriot law which operates in Italy under the freedom to provide investment services and activities thanks to the ‘European passport’, provided by MiFID2. According to EU law, the authorisation issued by the supervisory authority of the country of origin, in this case CySEC, entitles the company to operate in all other EU member states, subject to prior notification. Under the principle of home country control, the intermediary is subject to the supervision of CySEC, while the authorities of the host countries, including Consob, do not have supervisory powers. The ban will remain in force until CySEC provides adequate evidence to demonstrate that Rodeler Limited has definitively overcome the critical issues complained of by its Italian clients.	http://www.consob.it/web/consob-and-its-activities/warnings?viewId=ultime_com_tutela	3341

4512	investment companies	Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa	Italy	2019-05-23	Regarding market intermediaries (investment and trading advisers, collective investment schemes, brokers, dealers, and transfer agents)	Consob has detected a significant increase of reports relating to "investment companies" stating that they are authorised to operate by CONSOB itself or by other supervisory authorities of EU countries. These subjects illegally use, even on their own           more websites, identifying elements (company, brand, name or corporate name, headquarters, addresses, web and/or e-mail addresses, etc.) that are identical or similar to those of companies actually authorised and, sometimes, also refer to "licenses", whether valid or expired, issued by supervisory authorities to different subjects. By so doing, these subjects present themselves to potential customers as being authorised, often offering highly profitable investments in an underhand way. Considered that the initiatives undertaken by the so-called "clone" websites and/or companies might conceal deceptive operations aimed at taking possession of any money conferred, CONSOB invites investors to carefully consult the lists of investment firms actually authorised to operate in Italy (http://www.consob.it/web/area-pubblica/imprese-di-investimento1) as well as the investor protection warnings (http://www.consob.it/web/area-pubblica/avvisi-ai-risparmiatori) and, in any event, to be very careful before making investment decisions.	http://www.consob.it/web/consob-and-its-activities/warnings?viewId=ultime_com_tutela	4512

This company is a suspected boiler room. Haefen Capital has approached persons without being asked, to offer them investment propo           moresals. A boiler room is a collective term for fraudulent individuals and organizations using clever salespeople to call potential investors to pressure them into buying shares that promise high returns (cold calling). In reality the shares are either worthless or non-existent. The AFM has established that Haefen Capital does not have an AFM license or a European Passport.	https://www.afm.nl/nl-nl/consumenten/controleer-je-aanbieder/boiler-room/haefen-capital	5943

6965	CFDs, rolling spot forex, binary options	Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa	Italy	2017-02-13		CONSOB has published a communication for investor protection on the risks associated with new highly-speculative, risky and complex forms of financial investment such as contracts for difference (CFDs), rolling spot forex and binary options which, ov           moreer the last few years, have spread more widely in the various European Union countries, including Italy.The communication describes the CFDs, rolling spot forex and binary options between Italian clients and EU investment firms without a branch in Italy cannot be taken to the new Arbitrator for Financial Disputes (AFD), set up recently at CONSOB. In Italy, it must be added, the sector is characterised by the presence of numerous abusive subjects that do not have authorisation to operate, that offer contracts over the Internet without however being subject to administrative supervision by the Supervisory Authorities. In brief, in its warning CONSOB tells investors to take care, stressing that:-   investment in CFDs, rolling spot forex and binary options, is not suitable for most investors;-   this form of investment can entail losses even much greater than the capital initially invested;-   it is necessary to proceed to begin operations only after effectively understanding and assessing all the risks connected with the investment in question;-   it is necessary to ascertain always that the offering subject is authorised to operate in Italy, consulting the specific lists maintained by CONSOB (as regards investment firms) and by the Bank of Italy (as regards banks), which can be found on the respective institutional websites. To this end it is opportune to consult also the section “Warnings for investors” present on the CONSOB institutional website, containing the reports, coming from foreign supervisory authorities, as well as from CONSOB itself, of financial activities carried out abusively and of the subjects responsible for them.	http://www.consob.it/web/consob-and-its-activities/newsletter/documenti/english/en_newsletter/2017/year_23_n-05_13_february_2017.html#news2	6965

6981	transactions in diamonds	Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa	Italy	2017-02-07		The Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa (CONSOB) calls the attention of the public and of intermediaries on the buying and selling of diamonds with regard to which it has received reports from consumers’ associations.           moreThese concern commercial proposals made by specialised companies that operate through their websites or through bank branches. In these proposals diamonds are generally presented as a long-lasting, secure investment, with a possible prospect of a rising price over time and with a significant emphasis on the safe-haven characteristics. The purchase prices of the diamonds, determined directly by the proposer, are alleged to be higher than their market value. It is also alleged that, owing to the lack of transparency of the proposals, it is unclear what part of the price is due to the actual cost of the diamond and what instead is represented by the fees charged by the proposer companies and by the banks at the moment of the transaction.The rules on transparency and correctness of investment services are not in themselves applicable to the sale of diamonds or of any other tangible assets even if this occurs through the banking channel nor, in these cases, is the publication of a prospectus provided for. However, as already clarified by CONSOB, the sale of a tangible asset, such as diamonds, can assume the characteristics of an offering of a financial product if elements such as promises of returns, repurchase obligations, making of profits or constraints on the enjoyment of the asset are explicitly provided for, also through related contracts.On the possible presence of these elements CONSOB has in progress specific investigations and has begun collaboration with the Bank of Italy and with the Italian Anti-Trust Authority. It is, in any case, of fundamental importance that potential purchasers be informed that these are investments that can present risks that are not immediately perceivable. CONSOB, therefore, calls the attention of the public to this circumstance and to the need to take the maximum caution in carrying out such operations and recommends always following the general rule of considering acceptance of contractual proposal only when one has an adequate understanding and only when assisted by clear and complete documentation. Finally, CONSOB affirms the need for the purchase bidders - in particular if they are banking operators, conscious of the objective reliability offered by their specific professional position - to make the potential buyers completely aware of the rules applicable, the contractual conditions and the cost, including fees, present in the sales transactions proposed at the branch.	http://www.consob.it/mainen/target/investors/warnings/warnings.html?queryid=mainen.result.warnings&maxres=10&resultmethod=tutela&search=1&symblink=/mainen/target/investors/warnings/index.html	6981

It had never been licensed or otherwise authorised by the Financial Services Commission and there do not appear to be any links between the company’s owners and the operators of the current website.The website’s Contact page claims that it has a ‘Head Office’ in Gibraltar, but the address provided is bogus.A Gibraltar telephone provided on the website is unlisted and was being redirected to be answered outside Gibraltar.The FSC therefore urges the public to exercise appropriate caution in respect of this entity, whilst it continues its investigations.The FSC is also aware that there appear to be bona fide companies with ‘Nova Nordic’ in their name, and would like to distinguish between these companies and the subject of its public warning.People are able to verify whether a firm is licensed by the FSC in Gibraltar, by checking our Regulated Entities section.Any persons who are already involved in any dealings with the above entity and have concerns, should contact the Manager, Enforcement on +350 200 40283 or by e-mail.	http://www.fsc.gi/enforcement/fscwarning0057.htm	8400

He used high-pressure sales tactics to entice the person to invest in the derivatives market through Best Commodity Options, an investment company that is seemingly domiciled in Panama. Neither Gary Wallace nor Best Commodity Options is registered with the AMF.	https://lautorite.qc.ca/en/general-public/media-centre/news/fiche-dactualites/caution-caution-with-regard-to-solicitations-in-the-derivatives-market/	9933

Generally, they offer access to a software or an investment system in exchange for payment of a few hundred dollars, or even thousands of dollars, while promising very attractive returns. Subsequently, these companies put investors in contact with a so-called brokerage firm to make a deposit for future transactions. As a selling point, these companies will usually use the possibility to be reimbursed if no profit has been generated upon the contract term.	https://lautorite.qc.ca/en/general-public/media-centre/news/fiche-dactualites/watch-out-for-miracle-software-that-offers-a-return-that-is-too-good-to-be-true/	9998

10168	United Capital Forex Limited	Gibraltar Financial Services Commission	Gibraltar	2012-03-22		The Financial Services Commission would like to alert members of the public with regards to its name and logo being used on a forged letter.           more This letter had been submitted to a UK financial services firm, together with a bogus copy of a licence which is purported to have been issued by the Mauritius Financial Services Commission. The letter referred to "Authorisation under Section 6 of the Financial Services (Markets in Financial Instruments) Act 2006", and that the "authorisation permits United Capital Forex Limited, with licence number FSC1485B to conduct certain investment services under the Act", having been "assigned to Category 2 as a Portfolio Manager." The FSC has, of course, never issued such a letter, which has clearly been designed with intent to convince the firm to which it was sent that the company was licensed by the FSC. United Capital Forex Limited was not previously known to the FSC. The register of companies at Companies House in Gibraltar has no record of any such company although the name and address match a company on the UK register of companies. Any persons who have received a similar letter are kindly requested to forward these to the Manager, Enforcement on +350 200 40283 or by e-mail to enforcement@fsc.gi.	http://www.fsc.gi/enforcement/fscwarning0043.htm	10168

10436	Online Investment Bank	Gibraltar Financial Services Commission	Gibraltar	2011-11-10		The Financial Services Commission has today issued a warning to the public regarding Online Investment Bank.           moreThis entity has been operating a website on which it claims to be a "bank established by Gibraltar offshore company (sic) and uniting the talented financial professionals who have long been operating in best investment markets worldwide."The site provides an incomplete address of an office building in Gibraltar, the PO Box of a regulated firm and the telephone number of a non-financial services business in Gibraltar, none of which have any connection to what the FSC believes is a bogus entity which may have set up the website with intent to defraud investors.Online Investment Bank is not regulated by the FSC, or licensed under the Financial Services (Banking) Act or any other Supervisory Acts to carry on deposit taking or any other financial services business in or from within Gibraltar. The Register of Companies in Gibraltar has no record of any company with that name.People are able to verify whether a firm is licensed by the Gibraltar FSC, by checking the "Regulated Entities Search" section on our website at http://www.fsc.gi/fsclists/Search.aspx.Any persons who are already involved in any dealings with the above entity and have concerns, should contact the Manager, Enforcement on +350 200 40283 or by e-mail to enforcement@fsc.gi.	http://www.fsc.gi/enforcement/fscwarning0041.htm	10436

10476	Segregated Payments Limited ('Segpay') amended 31/10/2011	Gibraltar Financial Services Commission	Gibraltar	2011-10-24		The Financial Services Commission has today amended its warning to the public regarding the above-named entities and associated websites.           moreThe original warning followed receipt of a complaint. During the course of its investigations, the FSC noted online references that indicated that SegPay is a trading name used by Segregated Payments Limited, a Gibraltar company, which describe it as an Internet Payment Service Provider (IPSP).Segregated Payments Limited is not regulated by the FSC, nor licensed under the Financial Services (EEA) (Payment Services) Regulations 2010, to carry on payment services activities in or from within Gibraltar.The firm has been in communication with the Commission and has advised that it has removed references to Gibraltar, set up a UK company and is applying to the UK FSA to be registered as a small payment institution. In light of this the FSC is updating its warning notice accordingly to reflect this representation.People are able to verify whether a firm is licensed by the Gibraltar FSC, by checking the "Regulated Entities Search" section on our website at http://www.fsc.gi/fsclists/Search.aspx.	http://www.fsc.gi/enforcement/fscwarning0040.htm	10476

This warning may be found at http://www.fsc.gi/enforcement/fscwarning0020.htm.'Reclaim Investment Bank, Gibraltar' and 'Cashback Investment Bank, Gibraltar' are not regulated by the FSC, or licensed under the Financial Services (Banking) Act or any other Supervisory Acts to carry on deposit taking or any other financial services business in or from within Gibraltar.Searches of the Register of Companies at Companies House (Gibraltar) confirm that these entities are not incorporated as companies in Gibraltar or registered as business names under the Business Names Registration Act.The FSC therefore urges the public to exercise appropriate caution in respect of these entities, or those using similar names, whilst it continues its investigations. People are also able to verify whether a firm is licensed, by checking the "Regulated Entities" section on our website at http://www.fsc.gi/fsclists/categorysearch.asp .

(International) Corporate Services Limited is not, nor has it ever been regulated by the FSC. Although the 'investments' referred to on the website do not appear to caught by the provisions of the Financial Services (Investment & Fiduciary Services) Act 1989, or the Financial Services (Markets in Financial Instruments) Act 2006, the FSC nevertheless urges the public to exercise appropriate caution in respect of this entity, given that it is no longer an existing company.Please note that the flyer and the website both refer to 'International' Corporate Services Limited without the brackets. Companies House (Gibraltar) states on its website that special authorisation is required for use of "Words which imply National or International Pre-Eminence", such as 'International'.People are also able to verify whether a firm is licensed, by checking the "Regulated Entities" section on our website at http://www.fsc.gi/fsclists/categorysearch.asp	http://www.fsc.gi/enforcement/fscwarning0032.htm	11251
